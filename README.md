In This project i used a simple pagination technique along with searching and sorting the data.

USAGE:

1. Simply add Pagination.js to your page. 
2. add a class "searchable" or "sortable" or both to your table header.
3. add data attr to each header in such a way that the value should be a key in json data.
4. difine "searchURL" and "paginationURL" in your page 

Thats it magic is done... Lets began the show.
